## [0.5.0] - 2023-06-25

### Added
- Cmake installation files have been re-worked based on nlohmann_json cmake
  so they work properly when find_package(etl VERSION REQUIRED) is used

- Package Config support added so other build systems can find and use etl easily.

### Changed

- Comment style has been changed from the cumbersom /**/ to ///

- Comment descriptions have also been fixed and updated

## [0.1.0] - 2023-05-26

### Added

- Initial "stable version" of the library released.

### Limitations

- The Result template specialzation for std::unique_ptr<OkType> does not support
  the `map(f)` or `mapErr(f)` methods, because I can't quite figure out how to make lambdas
  invokable on move only types like unique_ptr. The functionality is not really needed anyways,
  but maybe added in the future.

- The EnumerationIterable class can only handle contiguous Enum classes. e.g 1, 2, 3, 4....
  If your enum class has gaps in the sequence the iteration will fail. This should be fixed in the future,
  as it would be nice to iterate any trivial enum contiguous or not.

- When using the Result `mapErr()` method on `Error`, the paramater must not be a reference or const reference
  as the lambda won't be invokable, it must be passed as a copyable object, since it is converted into a const reference
  in the actual std::invoke call. Otherwise it will not run.
